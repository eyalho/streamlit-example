# streamlit_example

The logic of this tutorial example:
 - Creat a web page
 - Let user upload a CSV file
 - Show some of the CSV content into browser
 - Save the file locally
 - Process the file into a new CSV
 - Notify into browser when the process finished and show some result
 - Let user download the new CSV file



In order to install:\
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

In order to run:\
$ streamlit run app.py

It should print something like :  Local URL: http://localhost:8504,  Network URL: http://192.168.1.17:8504"\
Just load the url into your web browser :D
